            <p>We all know Rome, even if we have never been. It is with out a doubt the most beautiful city I have ever seen in person (and since we’re coming from Prague, which I had previously given this title to, it’s saying a lot).</p>
            <p>Like a woman who decides to age gracefully rather than opting for cosmetic surgery to cope with growing old, Rome is true and honest beauty. It is not a replica of its once-powerful self. For the most part, the statues and ruins that you see have not been refurbished or redone. They are the originals and you pass by them and accept them in their disfigured state, falling apart and slowly disappearing in time.</p>

            <p>I became emotional as our flight landed at the airport. I couldn’t explain why. I’ve never been to Rome, so how could I be so moved? The Eternal City, like the very few truly amazing cities in our world, evokes a passion for life that you don’t normally get. You kiss your wife on the Spanish Steps and drink an espresso near the Trevi Fountain. It’s a life you cannot live anywhere else; there is a feeling that is utterly Roman and you know that when you are here, you are living the fantasy – even for only a short time.</p>
            <p>There is a reason Rome has been flourishing for thousands of years and will still be great long after you are gone. When you walk down the streets, it’s like you have been transported back in time. A classic Rome that still exists if you just slow down and pay attention. The woman hanging her laundry three stories up, the confusing maze of streets that you hope to get lost in, the sound of a vespa coming up behind you: it’s here, and you love it. When you arrive in Rome, you say to your wife, <q>Why don’t we live here?! What is wrong with us?!</q></p>

            <p>Why do we opt for a typical reality and not live in this fantasy world of doing nothing in the afternoons, drinking wine with every meal and surrounding ourselves with ancient history? The answer is this: because not everyone can be a Roman. I can pretend for five nights, eat the gelato, walk the cobbled streets and act like Romeo to my beautiful wife, but to live in Rome permanently? The city is unforgiving and unapologetic. On our first night here, we almost got hit by a car and vespa all in the same crossing. Things just don’t make sense to a North American. Why do certain train doors open at a stop while others don’t? Why does traffic seem to go in every direction?</p>
            <p>To live in Rome, you must accept the city for its beauty and its flaws. Could I live here? Probably… but will I live here? Probably not. It will most likely remain a fantasy for me: visiting every once and a while, pretending to be Roman, if even just for a small portion of my existence.</p>

            <p>If you have never been to Rome, please, get yourself here before it’s too late! I cannot stress this enough, the food is amazing and strolling down an old Roman street is like walking into a painting. But please, promise me one thing when you visit: see the main ancient ruins, the Colosseum, the Palatine and Roman Forum, but spend most of your time slowing down the pace. Enjoy a two-hour lunch on a nice patio that overlooks a cobbled street, drink as much red wine as possible and just go for a walk. It will transport you into a life that we as North Americans are not meant to live.</p>
